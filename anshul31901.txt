The Prsetige


I like the movie because its well paced.It doesn't feel too slow or too fast,
and doesn't bore me for a moment.
The cast is all star and the acting is phenomenal.
The characters are very deep and very insightful.
The plot is amazing and the storyline is a masterpiece.
And also "Nicola Tesla"
